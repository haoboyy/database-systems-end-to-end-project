# End-to-End Data-Driven Database Application

## Project Overview
This project is the final project for **CSCI-GA.2433 Database Systems**.  
It implements an **end-to-end, data-driven database application** that integrates:

- an **OLTP / ODS relational database**
- **unstructured data processing**
- a **machine-learning–based analytics module**

to support workflow-driven business decision making.

The system demonstrates how insights derived from unstructured data are generated by a data-driven program module and integrated back into an operational database to support a workflow-based application.

## End-to-End Architecture

The system follows a layered end-to-end architecture spanning user interaction, application logic, data storage, analytics, and insight feedback.

**Key layers:**
- Frontend (user interaction)
- Application / API layer
- OLTP / ODS relational database
- Unstructured data processing pipeline
- Machine learning analytics
- Insight persistence back to the operational database

## Data-Driven Workflow

The following diagram illustrates the workflow-based application lifecycle supported by the database system:

![Workflow](diagrams/workflow.png)

1. Client submits a project request  
2. Request is persisted in the operational database  
3. Providers submit proposals  
4. ML pipeline ranks providers  
5. Results are written back and consumed by the application

## Data-Driven Analytics & ML Pipeline

Unstructured text (project descriptions, provider profiles, messages) is processed through a data-driven analytics pipeline:

**Pipeline stages:**
- Raw text ingestion  
- Text cleaning and normalization  
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF / embeddings)  
- Model training and validation  
- Provider ranking and recommendation

## Notes

- Cloud components shown in the architecture (Azure Data Lake, Azure ML, Synapse) represent the **target reference architecture**
- The implemented solution demonstrates a **local end-to-end working prototype** aligned with the enterprise design
